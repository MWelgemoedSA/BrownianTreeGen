# BrownianTreeGen

A generator for brownian trees.

It's a super simple java exercise, although I later plan to try and do complicated optimizations.

It supports multithreading, which gives a linear speed increase.

Command line arguments are x size, y size, pixels to place, #num threads

Example of a Brownian Tree generated with it:
